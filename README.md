# Machine Learning Projects Repository

This repository consists of a collection of Python-based machine learning projects implemented with various techniques, including linear regression, image classification, and the combination of unsupervised and supervised learning methods.

## Project Overview

1. **Ridge Regression and K-Fold Cross-Validation:** Implements Ridge Regression with an L2 regularization term and utilizes K-Fold Cross-Validation for model performance estimation.

2. **ResNet50 for Image Classification:** Uses the pre-trained ResNet50 neural network to extract features from images, which are then processed through a custom neural network for binary classification.

3. **Ridge Regression with Feature Transformation:** Demonstrates the use of Ridge Regression on transformed features, conducting fine-grained hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

4. **Combining Unsupervised and Supervised Learning:** Applies an autoencoder for unsupervised learning and dimensionality reduction, followed by Ridge Regression for supervised learning, to predict complex data with minimal training datasets.

## Dependencies

The projects in this repository require the following Python libraries:

- Scikit-learn
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas

To install these dependencies, run the following command:

```shell
pip install scikit-learn torch numpy pandas
```

## Usage

Each project directory contains a Python script, and potentially, additional files such as data sets or helper scripts. Navigate into the project directory and run the Python script to execute the project. Please ensure that any required data sets are available in the working directory or adjust the data loading code to suit your needs.

Please note that this repository does not include large files such as image databases or pre-trained model weights. Be sure to provide these files as necessary for each project. Adjustments to model architecture, hyperparameters, or data preprocessing may be necessary to best suit your specific use case.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this repository by creating a pull request or raising an issue. All contributions, including corrections, improvements, or extensions of the existing projects, are welcome.
